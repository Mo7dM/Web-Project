        <h3 class="montserrat-a mb-3">Our Story (Game Station)</h3>

        <p>
            In this project, our team collaborated to design and build a multi-page Game Rating Website where users
            can explore trending games, check gaming news, browse a full game database, and submit their own ratings.
            Before we started coding, we sketched mock-ups for every page to visualize layouts, color choices, icons,
            and overall user flow. These early sketches helped us stay organized, avoid confusion, and keep all pages
            consistent.
        </p>

        <p>
            We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build a clean, modern, and responsive interface that works smoothly on
            both desktop and mobile screens. Our main goal was to design a site that feels easy to navigate, visually
            appealing, and fun for anyone interested in discovering or rating games.
        </p>

        <h4 class="montserrat-a mt-4 mb-2">Challenges We Faced</h4>

        <p>
            Throughout development, we ran into a number of issues. One of the biggest challenges was making sure
            all pages were properly linked so that the navigation bar worked everywhere. Sometimes, incorrect file
            paths caused pages or images to break, and we had to carefully check the folder structure to fix them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making the website responsive was another challenge. Some elements looked misaligned on smaller screens,
            especially game images and text inside the database. By using Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive tools,
            we were able to solve most of these issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also dealt with problems related to image formatting, like unsupported formats or incorrect dimensions,
            which caused certain images not to load. Fixing these required multiple tests and adjustments, but each
            issue helped us improve our troubleshooting skills.
        </p>

        <h4 class="montserrat-a mt-4 mb-2">Project Work & Page Breakdown</h4>

        <p>
            Each page in the website has its own purpose and plays a role in the full user experience.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Game Station (Home Page):</strong><br>
            The homepage welcomes users and includes an Upcoming Events section showing the most highly anticipated
            gaming events. It also contains a registration form with validation for names, mobile number, and email.
            The form shows error messages when inputs are incorrect, helping users fill it out properly.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Top Gaming News Page:</strong><br>
            This page highlights the latest updates from the gaming world, including trending releases and major
            announcements. Each piece of news includes a title, summary, and image to make browsing easier.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Game Database Page:</strong><br>
            A list of games displaying the genres, the platforms it’s available on, both their active and peak player
            counts, helping users discover new titles and see how active they are before making a purchase.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Rating Page:</strong><br>
            Users can share their feedback and rate each game on a scale of 1 to 10. These ratings make the website
            more engaging for the average user and give a stronger sense of involvement in the gaming community; it
            could help future users discover their next favorite game by highlighting the top-rated titles in each
            genre.
        </p>

        <h4 class="montserrat-a mt-4 mb-2">Technical Learning</h4>

        <p>
            This project significantly improved our front-end development skills. We learned how to structure
            multi-page websites, validate forms using JavaScript, and use Bootstrap to build cleaner and more
            responsive layouts.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also learned to fix broken links, handle image loading issues, and design better user interactions
            through simple and clean UI components. Testing on different screens taught us how important responsiveness
            and consistency are when building real websites. Overall, this project gave us hands-on experience creating
            a functional and user-friendly website.
